// THIS REPOSITORY IS DERIVED FROM THE WORKSHOP POSTED HERE:
http://futuretheater.net/wiki/Kinect_Workshop

The examples are xcode projects designed to work on a mac.  for generic kinect libraries see
http://openkinect.org/wiki/Main_Page

I've created a new app called kinectWorkshop which combines many basic kinect examples into one executable.  This was designed for a presentation format, so you can cycle through various functionalities without needing to restart.  I created two of my own examples to manipulate the depth map and hand tracking features.  

The repository is a bundle containing OpenFrameworks7 and all libraries you need to run the examples on a mac. For help installing, follow the steps here:
